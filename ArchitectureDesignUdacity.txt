some stuff TBAdded

What is the key design question with which any implementation of TestBrowser must deal?


31:

Software Design: The Process of buidin a program while satisfying a problem's functional requirements and not violating its non-functional requirements

Two Parts:
Architectural Design
Detail Design

Architectural design:
The process of Identifying and assigning the responsibility for aspects of beahavior to various modules or components of Software

Detail Design:
The Process of specifying the behavior of each of the system components that you have identified during Architectural design
particularly w.r.t their Datastructures and Algorithms

The Primary activity during detailed design is to select logical representations of data objects identified during the requirements definition and specification phase. The selection process may involve algorithmic analysis of alternative structures in order to determine the most efficient design or may simply involve the use of a set of modules that provide the operations upon some representation of an object

Pseudo Code; Program Design Language(PDL):
Keywords, free syntax of natural language, data declaration, sub-program definition and calling

Structured Programming:
Sequence, Condition, repetition, chunking

Flow charts, Call Graphs:
Directed Graphs: node is computational unit, arc is flow of control

Decision Tables:
Rules, Conditions, actions

33: Approaches to Software Design:
More structured: OO Design
Some for Real Time systems
Some as only part of an application, ex. User Interface

Design method, Design representation, Design validation

Method: A method is a systematic sequence of steps that a design team uses to solve a problem
Design method acts as a discipline for designers and implementers to think in certian ways
Ex: OO Design, Structured Design, Role based design

34: Issues with Design

Are you going to do things top down? or Bottom up or Inside out?
Are you going to begin by thinking of procedures nad functions or in terms of nouns and objects like OO design.

Conceptual Integrity vs Cooperative development

Long-term maintainability vs Short term schedule

What tools are you going to use to support the above decisions

35: Design Validation:
Review, Walkthrough, Inspection by team or tools based checking

Issues withh Design Validation:
Independence of validators
Dependence on design method
On-going vs after the fact


36: Other Design Issues:

Architectural vs Detail Design
Functional behavior vs non-functional constraints
Specification/what vs Design/how
Application Specificity

37: Design Documentation:
For large designs, the scale and complexity beg to have a design documentation
If maintenance is going to be done by different people, it will be of great help
Different kinds of methods, different kinds of applications require differnt kinds of documentation
Formal Multi-volume, to scribble notes to presentations

38: Traditional Design Documentation
Subcomponents:
-Processes/activities
-Data/data flows
Control FLow:
-Control regime
Performance
Resources

For more detailed documentation, use IEEE 1016

39: Leonardo Objects
Stakeholders: views/interests; work procedures
Issue bases: Issues, alternatives, analyses, resolutions(commitments, decisions), rationale, impacts, conflicts
Temporal relations: histories, schedules, transformations, versions(revisions, releases, variants)
Constraints: Internal, external,(requirements, specifications)
Aggregates: Configurations, packages, components

40: Design Rationale:
Design decisions are explicit choices of how to trade off two non-functional aspects of a design, such as speed versus size

41: Coupling and Cohesion
Coupling: The extent to which two components depend on each other for successful execution
- Low coupling is good. They are also very easy to maintain, and debug.
Cohesion: The xtent to which a component has a single pupose or function
- High cohesion is good. They are also much more easy to reuse.

42: Information Hiding:
Abstraction so teh internal functionality is not visible to the outside world

43: Abstractionand refinement
Abstraction Mechanisms:
- Declarative: what, not how
- Aggregation: Container, not contents
- Generalization: class, not individuals
- Parameterzation: binding details later
- Non-determinism: Leaving choices unspecified

44: Aesthetics
Three things are needed for beauty:
wholeness, harmony and radiance -Aquinas

For Software: Completeness, consistency and conceptual integrity

"I made this letter very long, because I didn't have the leisure to make it shorter" -Pascal

45: Design Philosophy
Descartes: Analysis; use of models
Marx: Understanding teh social context of design solutions; user-centered design
Heidegger: tools fo accomplishing goals; CASE, IDE
Wittgenstein - Language games desktop metaphor

46: Observations:
Design is the most creative part of the software developmetn process
Overall system quality is highly dependen on the designs produced
A Key determinan of design quality is the extent of experience of this on similar projects in particular, of members of teh design team

47: Diagrams
Diagrams: Doing design, you need to be able to represent those designs and a very popular mehod of doing that is by using Diagrams
Some of the oldest techniques are Flowcharts to wite control logic of an algorithm
Other sophisticated methods are Ex: SADT, Jackson Design, Structure Design and so on.

In 1980s, OOPS emeged and with them came their own particular approach to diagramming


48: OMT:
Object Management Technique:
Class Model Diagram => State Chart Diagram => Data Flow Diagram

49: UML
The history of trying to unify the different aspects of teh system in different diagrams let to the Unified Modeling Language or the UML
Standardised by Object Managemetn Group(OMG)
Supported by CASE tools
Conceived by three architects Rumbaugh, Booch and Jacobson
Diagrams + OCL
Used for analysis or design models
Analysis diagram => concerned with the problem we are solving
Design diagram => concerned with the solution to the problem

50: Diagram Types:
UML 2 has 14 different kinds of diagrams
Understand the trickiest part of the project and use the diagrm that helps you best understand the tricky part

Two main categories of Diagrams:
Structural
Behavioral

Structural: Gives you teh pieces of teh system that are always there and the relationship among them

Behavioral: Concerned with the executions of the system. The particular diagram may only onvey only one execution. May have to have multiple sequence duiagrams in order to get a good feel fo all of teh behaviors of the system.

51: Class Models
Class Model Diagram:
Most Popular
Also called static model
Structural relationships
Has Classes and relationships

52: UML Classes:
Have 3 compartments
Top compartmnet-> Name of Class
Middle compartment-> Attributes
Third/last compartment has Methods or Operations that class provides

53: UML Relationships
Dependency: X uses Y, Dashed line, directed line
Associations: X affects Y Solid undirected line(X contains an instance of Y for example))
Generalisation: X is a kind of Y; Solid line with large, open arroeehead(X is a Kind of Y))

54: Example Class Diagram

55: Object Diagram:
Same or similar to Class Model diagram
The Label compartment at the top of the boxes has an underlined text line
Label(Text line) => Instance <colon> Class name
Used to convey the specific use of the classes involved in a class model diagram
Attribute fields have attribute values

56: Composite Structure Diagram
A structural diagram which shows the internal structure of a class
Left side of interior class(horizontal lines coming out) are interfaces
Provides interface has circle at the end of line
Requires interface has semi circle at the end of line

57: Component diagram
=> Static Implementation view:
A physical, replacable part of a system that provides implementation and conforms to and provides the realization of a set of interfaces - UML Reference Manual
Used to Model code entities
Used to convey architecture

58: Example Component Diagram
Rectangle with two sub rectangles on the sides, indicate components
Dashed lines indicate where components plug into other components

59: Deployment Diagram
In a complex system, systems may run on different processing units and we'd like to convey the configuration of the run time processing units and their component instances in a way that sees how they can interact.
A Node in teh diagram will correspond to a computational device and Arcs indicate some kind of communication

Deployment Diagram => "Configuration of run-time processing nodes and the component instances and objects that live on them" - UML Reference Manual

60: Example Component Diagram

61: Packages
General Purpose Organizing mechanisms
Provides namespace scoping
System is the top level package
Dependency arrows between packages indicate the existence of dependencies between constituents

62: Example Class Diagram with Packages UML 1.5
Package has a small Tab in its upper left hand corner with a label on it and there are also inter package dependencies with dashed lines ending in an arrowhead

63: Example Package DIagram UML 2.0

64: Peofile Diagram
Higher LEvel: Properties of diagrams, not models
Profiles allow you to extend the basic UML notation
Final Structural Diagram

65: Example Profile Diagram
Used in extending the UML language to deal with describing certain kinds of systems

66: Behavior Diagrams

2nd MAIN TYPE OF DIAGRAMS

Focused on specific uses
You may need to have multiple sequence diagrams, multiple collaboration diagrams to convey or give an idea of overall system.

67: Usecase Diagrams
UML doesnot include Dat Flow diagrams
Instead it includes Jacobson's usecase diagrams
Usecase is a sequence of user-visible actions along with system responses
Its a story of how a system deals with a particular user interaction
Useful for eliciting system requirements adn organizing development acivities
You lay-out different stories of how the system is going to be used and the explore ramifications. What happens if something goes wrong, what are some intermediate steps that maybe you didn't make explicit.

68: Usecase Diagrams - 2
Stick figures denote external actors(typiclly system users, may also stand for other systems or external devices)
Ovals are usecases
Usecase diagram is not a system story. Its a description of a set of system stories
Lines without annotation indicate participation. The actor at one end is involved in the usecase oval at the other end. There're two annotations available in usecase diagrams. One is the extends annotation and one is teh uses annotation.
<<extends>> and <<uses>> stereotype support factoring
Extends mean that you have one story and you'd like to extend it by some other contingencies, essentially getting two for the price of one. The uses stereotype is like a sub-routine or, or function call. <<uses>> is more like a function call, that can be used by onen or more usecases

69: Example Usecase Diagrams

70: Individual Usecases
Use Case Diagrams convey a system of system uses and actors that are involved with them

Usecases themselves may be conveyed with unstructured text or in table

Example: Foster wants to buy a book. He goes to teh amazon website and browses to find his book. He adds it to his shopping cart. He then goes to teh check-out page where he provides his billing information and confirms his purchase.

71: Tabular Version of Example:

Ex:
Actor => Action => Obejct
Foster => Browses => Amazon website
Foster => selects => book
Foster => adds => book, shopping cart
Foster => checks-out
Amazon => requests => billing information
Foster => provides => name, address, credit
Amazon => verifies => credit information
Foster => confirms => purchase

Both the above are examples of usecases, and they would represent teh content of one of teh ovals used in the usecase diagram
