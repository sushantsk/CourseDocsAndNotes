What is the key design question with which any implementation of TestBrowser must deal?

Software Design: The Process of buidin a program while satisfying a problem's functional requirements and not violating its non-functional requirements

Two Parts:
Architectural Design
Detail Design

Architectural design:
The process of Identifying and assigning the responsibility for aspects of beahavior to various modules or components of Software

Detail Design:
The Process of specifying the behavior of each of the system components that you have identified during Architectural design
particularly w.r.t their Datastructures and Algorithms

The Primary activity during detailed design is to select logical representations of data objects identified during the requirements definition and specification phase. The selection process may involve algorithmic analysis of alternative structures in order to determine the most efficient design or may simply involve the use of a set of modules that provide the operations upon some representation of an object

Pseudo Code; Program Design Language(PDL):
Keywords, free syntax of natural language, data declaration, sub-program definition and calling

Structured Programming:
Sequence, Condition, repetition, chunking

Flow charts, Call Graphs:
Directed Graphs: node is computational unit, arc is flow of control

Decision Tables:
Rules, Conditions, actions

33: Approaches to Software Design:
More structured: OO Design
Some for Real Time systems
Some as only part of an application, ex. User Interface

Design method, Design representation, Design validation

Method: A method is a systematic sequence of steps that a design team uses to solve a problem
Design method acts as a discipline for designers and implementers to think in certian ways
Ex: OO Design, Structured Design, Role based design

34: Issues with Design

Are you going to do things top down? or Bottom up or Inside out?
Are you going to begin by thinking of procedures nad functions or in terms of nouns and objects like OO design.

Conceptual Integrity vs Cooperative development

Long-term maintainability vs Short term schedule

What tools are you going to use to support the above decisions

35: Design Validation:
Review, Walkthrough, Inspection by team or tools based checking

Issues withh Design Validation:
Independence of validators
Dependence on design method
On-going vs after the fact


36: Other Design Issues:

Architectural vs Detail Design
Functional behavior vs non-functional constraints
Specification/what vs Design/how
Application Specificity
